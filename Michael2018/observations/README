## THIS IS SUPERSEDED BY README IN STORM_SURGE_PREDICTION REPO ##
## Create scatterplot of model and observed water heights.

download high water marks, and rapid deployment gage and pressure transducer data with obs_adcirc.py
% python obs_adcirc.py

Not sure how Google Sheet was created.

zeta_max.ncl reads netCDF version of Google Sheet (read and saved by get_obs.py) or output from obs_adcirc.py, HWMs.Event287.nc.

Hand off to zeta_max.ncl
ncl 'modeldir="$TMPDIR/nos/output/Michael2018/bt/work/"' zeta_max.ncl


Old workflow for obs_adcirc.py below.
wget -O HWMs.Event287.csv "https://stn.wim.usgs.gov/STNServices/HWMs/FilteredHWMs.csv?Event=287&States=&County=&HWMType=&HWMQuality=&HWMEnvironment=&SurveyComplete=&StillWater="
had to fix broken lines in 'https://stn.wim.usgs.gov/STNServices/Instruments/FilteredInstruments.csv?Event=287&States=&County=&SensorType=&CurrentStatus=&CollectionCondition=&DeploymentType='
mv FilteredInstruments.csv?Event=287&States=&County=&SensorType=&CurrentStatus=&CollectionCondition=&DeploymentType= Sensor.Event287.csv
